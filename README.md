# Introduction
Imagine that a person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions, and then does not show up. Who is to blame? This is a significant issue, and we are here to analyze it and find solutions.

# Dataset Description
This dataset collects information from 110,527 medical appointments in Brazil and focuses on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointments. Let's take a deep dive into each column and provide a detailed explanation of the data based on the descriptions given for each field:

* Gender: Indicates the gender of the patient (Male or Female). The dataset notes a higher proportion of females, suggesting women tend to take better care of their health compared to men.
* DataMarcacaoConsulta: The actual date of the appointment, representing when the patient is scheduled to visit the doctor.
* DataAgendamento: The date on which the appointment was scheduled, always preceding or equal to the appointment date.
* Age: The age of the patient.
